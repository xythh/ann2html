This program does not need to be installed, simply move it wherever 
you like, and copy in vocab.db each time you run it.
you can also set the environment variable $ANN2HTML_VOCABDB to the location of your vocab.db

Your vocab.db is usually found under

DRIVELETTER:\system\vocabulary\vocab.db 
where DRIVELETTER is the drive letter for your kindle.

This folder might be hidden as Windows hides the vocab.db file in odd
ways, so if you are unable to find it go to your kindle's drive and
then search for vocab.db in windows explorer, then copy vocab.db
into the folder ann2html.exe is in.

After vocab.db is found running ann2html will generate an edit.html file
with your highlighted annotations. Each time you run ann2html it will see 
if the found vocab.db is new, and if it is it will regenerate edit.html
