Move this folder to wherever you want it to be, ann2html will look for a config
in the directory where the ann2html executable is or the environment variable
$ANN2HTML_CONFIG

Your kindle's vocab.db is under
MOUNTPOINT/system/vocabulary/vocab.db


Running ann2html will generate an edit.html file with your highlighted
annotations. Each time you run ann2html it will see if the found
vocab.db is new, and if it is it will regenerate edit.html

If you would like to use the ann script, then find your kindles UUID
and add it to the script. More detailed instructions below.



To find your uuid run ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid and then connect your kindle and run it again.
ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Nov 10 00:00 3472-5482 -> ../../nvme
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Nov 10 00:00 3472-54821212 -> ../../nvme2
PLUG IN KINDLE AND RUN AGAIN
ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Nov 10 00:00 3472-5482 -> ../../nvme
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Nov 10 00:00 3251-54821212 -> ../../nvme2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Nov 10 00:00 3582-6578 -> ../../sda
in this example the UUID you want is 3582-6578 
Then in the script called ann add your kindle uuid to the following line.

kindle_UUID=
kindle_UUID=3582-6578
