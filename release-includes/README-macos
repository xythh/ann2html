This program does not need to be installed, simply move it wherever you
like, and copy in vocab.db each time you run it.
you can also set the environment variable $ANN2HTML_VOCABDB to the location of your vocab.db

Your kindle's vocab.db is under
MOUNTPOINT/system/vocabulary/vocab.db

Running ann2html will generate an edit.html file with your highlighted
annotations. Each time you run ann2html it will see if the found
vocab.db is new, and if it is it will regenerate edit.html
