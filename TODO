Change windows and mac versions to not depend on being "installed", just use
relative directories from pwd.
change the template file to use go html templates.
Change variable find logic, ENV VARIABLES > local directory on mac windows.
think, make linux also like windows and mac or use xdg?
validate language codes and use string builder and a function to build out the sql command.
throw error if invalid language code.
remove tabindex on p elements, useless weird hack.
