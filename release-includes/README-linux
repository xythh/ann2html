Move all these files to $HOME/.config/ann2html

if ann2html finds vocab.db it will generate your highlighted annotations
to edit.html, simply give it a new vocab.db and run it again to get your
new annotations.

If you would like to use the ann script, then find your kindles UUID and add it to the script. More detailed instructions below.



To find your uuid run ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid and then connect your kindle and run it again.
ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Nov 10 00:00 3472-5482 -> ../../nvme
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Nov 10 00:00 3472-54821212 -> ../../nvme2
PLUG IN KINDLE AND RUN AGAIN
ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Nov 10 00:00 3472-5482 -> ../../nvme
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Nov 10 00:00 3251-54821212 -> ../../nvme2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Nov 10 00:00 3582-6578 -> ../../sda
in this example the UUID you want is 3582-6578 
Then in the script called ann add your kindle uuid to the following line.

kindle_UUID=
kindle_UUID=3582-6578
